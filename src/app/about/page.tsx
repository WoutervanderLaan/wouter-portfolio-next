        Rather than a reductive inquiry into the essential characteristics of
        his work, Wouter van der Laan (Huizen, NL, 1993) is interested in its
        multiplicity, celebrating confusion, doubt, and entanglement as
        generative forces.

        His practice moves nomadically through different His practice moves
        nomadically through different environments, where it finds moments of
        connection, enrichment, and hybridization. What is brought along is
        reiterated, reflected on, and reorganized in relation to what is
        encounter on its way. I.e. in the installation series ‘Nest’, for which
        he moved his entire studio content to various locations where everything
        was site-responsively reorganized.

        This work has since provided the material for new work: Discarded
        paintings were recycled as threads for knitting; wooden beams were
        turned into man-sized knitting needles. A knitting club was set up,
        where Individual making met with social exchange.

        Every iteration of the work carries the traces of earlier states and
        situations, either through documentation or through the visible marks
        and scars of its past. It functions as an organically growing archive
        and travelogue that lives, morphs and connects through various times and
        situations, provoking a state of continuous becoming. In the process of
        creating, all works become provisional structures that generate new
        elements for future work.
