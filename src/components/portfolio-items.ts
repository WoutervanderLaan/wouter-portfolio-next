      "The space resembles a traditional informal textile workspace, based on historical examples of communal textile gatherings that were common in Medieval Europe. As a kind of late-Medieval night-life, these gatherings offered a platform both for the learning and sharing of textile crafts, as well as a place for story telling; collective singing; relaxation; courting; and much more. Gathered around the hearth, one could find a place for refuge from paternal supervision and control, and as such allowed for a countercultural and subversive potential to emerge.",

    description:
      "A late medieval woodcut print depicts a village spinning bee spun out of control. At the time, it was distributed as propaganda, showing a moralistic speculation of the unruly orgiastic events that the authorities imagined took place at the local spinning bees. These textile gatherings were notorious for their transgression of norms, and indeed offered nightly refuge from paternal supervision for the (young) villagers to engage in social, sexual and other forms of communal experimentation. As such, it offered a place for countercultural and subversive potential. These bees eventually got prohibited, pushing them underground and into obscurity, continuing in the dark of night. In the absence of any textile facilities at the Rijksakademie, an impromptu textile workshop has been set up, following the tradition of the nightly village spinning bee. Communal touch-based textile processes facilitate unruly entanglements. Moments of weaving and spinning are met with forms of informal knowledge production and exchange. The space is a breeding ground for the knotting of various lines of thought, threads and bodies. At night these are expressed through touch rather than vision.",
